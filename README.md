# Sokoban-pathfinding

Description of the problem refers to https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.ai.sokobanpathfinding.

The core of the problem is BFS(Breadth First Search) algorithm on a binary array(vector<string>).

Note: 
1. Get the map from input(string);
2. Output should be ONLY the solution to system.out;
3. The map might not be a rectangular(which means you need to write a loop to get the actual size of the graph!!!);
4. Type of Struct should be initialized.
